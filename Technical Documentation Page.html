          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <div class="info">
            <p>
              JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting
              language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host
              environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be
              connected to the objects of its environment to provide
              programmatic control over them.
            </p>
            <p>
              JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
              Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
              operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
              be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
              additional objects; for example:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model
                (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application
                to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events
                such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
              </li>
              <li>
                Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
                server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with
                a database, provide continuity of information from one
                invocation to another of the application, or perform file
                manipulations on a server.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <h2>What you should already know</h2>
          <div class="info">
            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web
                (WWW).
              </li>
              <li>
                Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).
              </li>
              <li>
                Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try
                one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.

          <h2>JavaScript and Java</h2>
          <div class="info">
            <p>
              JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
              different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java
              but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
              JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
              and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
              renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
              In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
              declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a
              small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and
              string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model
              instead of the more common class-based object model. The
              prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what
              is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also
              supports functions without any special declarative requirements.
              Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed
              methods.
            </p>
            <p>
              JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do
              not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do
              not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private,
              or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces.
              Variables, parameters, and function return types are not
              explicitly typed.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h2>Hello world</h2>
          <div class="info">
            <p>
              To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and
              write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
            </p>
            <div class="code">
              <code>
                function greetMe(yourName) {<br />
                &nbsp;alert("Hello " + yourName);<br />
                }<br />
                greetMe("World");
              </code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in
              your browser!
            </p>
          </div>
